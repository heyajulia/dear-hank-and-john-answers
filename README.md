# dear-hank-and-john-questions

This repo contains a chronological list of every question John and Hank have ever answered on their (excellent) podcast,
[Dear Hank & John][dhj].

There's a human-readable questions.md file, and a machine-readable episodes.json file that contains additional
information that might be useful to computers.
